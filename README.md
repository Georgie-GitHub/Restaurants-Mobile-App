# Restaurants-Mobile-App
A social dining app that helps users discover and share restaurant plans with friends. The Restaurants Tab displays a map of nearby restaurants, allowing users to view details and mark their selection, which expires after 12 hours. The Friends Tab shows a list of friends and their chosen restaurants, with an option to add new friends from contacts for seamless coordination.

# Restaurants tab

Clicking on the Restaurants tab should show a map with nearby restaurants.
Clicking on a restaurant should pull up the restaurant details (feel free to get creative with what level of detail you want to show here). The user should see a button to click that indicates he/she is going to that particular restaurant.
The user's restaurant selection will expire in 12 hours. After their selection expires, prompt the user to select a new restaurant.

# Friends tab

Clicking on the Friends tab should show a list of the user's friends and which restaurant they'll be eating at.
Initially, since the user won't have any friends, this screen should also show the option to add a friend from the user's contacts, after which both the user and his/her friend will be able to see which restaurants they are going to
